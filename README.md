## Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI): Foundational Study Tabular Baseline Data - Release 1

# Dr. Mario Masellis, Dr. Douglas Munoz, Dr. Michael Strong, Dr. Richard Swartz, ONDRI study team

# Overview

ONDRI’s Foundational Study includes data from 520 people living with Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, or cerebrovascular disease, along with their care partners. Detailed clinical, cognitive, genetic, gait, balance, eye tracking, retinal imaging, and neuroimaging assessments were performed that enable multi-modality within- and cross-disease analyses. Data were collected from 2014-18; then standardized, cleaned, and curated to facilitate open access and sharing.

# Cohorts

1. 126 Alzheimer's/mild cognitive impairment participants

2. 53 Frontotemporal lobar degeneration participants

3. 40 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) participants

4. 140 Parkinson's disease participants

5. 161 Cerebrovascular disease participants


# Data organization and file format

- DATA (required): Contains all participant data. All data is in csv for this data release.

- DICT (required): Explanation of all the variables and range of values found in the DATA file.

- MISSING (required if there are any participants that do not have sufficient data in the DATA file; otherwise, not required): Information about missing participants and general reasons they are not included in the DATA file.

- README (required): A summary of what files are present in a data package and a short description of each file.

- METHODS (optional): a document detailing methods or techniques used to gather data. These files are in the .pdf format.

- SUP (optional): Supplementary document containing any additional information that is not conveyed in other files in a data package. These files can be either in the .csv or .txt format.


# Access information

To gain access to Brain-CODE Controlled Data Release data, Study Investigators will submit requests via Data Release Portals at www.braincode.ca. These requests will be reviewed by the Brain-CODE Data Access Committee and the Brain-CODE Steering Committee. Learn more about these Committees in the Brain-CODE Governance Policy (https://braininstitute.ca/docs/Brain-CODE-Governance-Policy-version-FINAL.pdf).
