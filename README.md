# Dr. Mario Masellis, Dr. Douglas Munoz, Dr. Michael Strong, Dr. Richard Swartz, ONDRI study team

# Overview

ONDRI’s Foundational Study includes data from 520 people living with Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, or cerebrovascular disease, along with their care partners. Detailed clinical, cognitive, genetic, gait, balance, eye tracking, retinal imaging, and neuroimaging assessments were performed that enable multi-modality within- and cross-disease analyses. Data were collected from 2014-18; then standardized, cleaned, and curated to facilitate open access and sharing. The release includes tabular data from all assessment platforms in addition to raw neuroimaging files. Baseline and Longitudinal data are now available for request.

# Data organization

Data is organized into packages by Treatment Group, Timepoint, Imaging Data Type, Genomic Data Type, Spectral Domain Optical Coherence, Eyetracking, Neurophsychology and Clinical Data Collection Domain.
